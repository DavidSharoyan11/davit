					<h2>Yerevan.Armenia</h2>
					<p>Yerevan is an ancient city founded 2,800 years ago on the hills of Erebuni. The remains of that first settlement are still standing; however, Yerevan has by far outgrown them and become a large modern city with a lot of things to see and more than 1 million inhabitants. Over the past 28 centuries, Armenia’s capital has suffered wars, sieges, and earthquakes. At the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan underwent a massive reconstruction. For the first time, the city got its own general plan, conceived by Alexander Tamanian. The architect’s vision and heritage is still visible in the city’s skyline. Some of his iconic and revolutionary designs have made it onto our list of the top seven must-see sights in Yerevan.</p>

						<h2>The Republic Square</h2>
						<p>The centerpiece of Tamanian’s urban design is the Republic Square in Yerevan. The square is surrounded by a magnificent architectural ensemble comprised of four buildings designed in the same style and the building that hosts the National Gallery and the History Museum. The building with the clock tower is the seat of the Armenian Government. Across the street is the office of the Post, featuring a tall arch. According to the original concept, if you look straight into the arch from the opposite side of the street, you can see Mount Ararat framed by it.Two other buildings in the ensemble are the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Marriot Hotel.The fifth building, which differs somewhat from the rest of the ensemble, houses the two largest museums of Armenia. </p>

					<h2>Seoul. South Korea</h2>
					<p>Except for a brief interregnum (1399–1405), Seoul was the capital of Korea from 1394 until the formal division of the country in 1948. The name itself has come to mean “capital” in the Korean language. The city was popularly called Seoul in Korean during both the Chosŏn (Yi) dynasty (1392–1910) and the period of Japanese rule (1910–45), although the official names in those periods were Hansŏng (Hanseong) and Kyŏngsŏng (Gyeongseong), respectively.
